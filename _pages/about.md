UCLAT team is part of UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London, investigating the potential of analytics, artificial intelligence and technology to support human learning. We are particularly interested in supporting students' ability to learn how to learn and solve complex problems collaboratively.  Our work aims to address the pressing social-educational challenge of preparing people for a future that will require a great deal more than the routine cognitive skills currently prized by many education systems.

## Main Themes of Research

1. **Human-AI collaboration** in teaching and learning contexts.
2. Computational and statistical models of collaboration and regulation of learning behaviours of humans with **multimodal learning analytics**.
3. Design and use of **analytics feedback interventions** for reflection and regulation for effective pedagogical support, and their impact in real-world settings. 
4. Psychological and socio-scientific challenges in the **adoption of AI and analytics technologies** in educational practice.



> How can we design, build, and implement AI and analytics solutions providing opportunities for augmented human capabilities for learning?

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
